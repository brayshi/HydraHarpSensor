## HydraHarpSensor
Developed using Python 3.9.7 and Matplotlib 3.4.3 to produce a live plot trace for monitoring photon counts with the HydraHarp 400.
When started in the command line, a graph with 100 ms photon bins on the y-axis and time [s] on the x-axis will start producing values on the graph

## USAGE
